# Coral-Bleaching-Analysis

### How Have Climatic Events Influenced Recent Trends in Global Coral Bleaching?

### Motivation
A recent increase in the vulnerability of coral reefs and their critical need for mitigation strategies motivates this analysis on the relationship between coral bleaching patterns and climatic changes. For our analyses we used a database published in Nature that compiled over 34,000 records of coral bleaching globally, with samples taken from 1980-2020 that include information about geographical location, environmental conditions, and bleaching prevalence across time.

### Findings
We completed a time-series analysis of coral bleaching incidents and cyclical occurrence of El Niño, which brings warmer waters to the tropical Pacific region every 3-5 years. We found that one of the highest peaks in substantial bleaching coincides with the 1998 El Niño, one of the most intense of these events to date. There is less correlation between these variables observed in the 1980s and early 90s in part due to there being far less data points when compared to the two most recent decades, where there is more concurrence between higher ONI values and increased rates of bleaching.

We also visualized bleaching severity against the thermal stress anomaly, a measure of the thermal stress on corals as a result of being forced to live closer to their upper thermal limit. The resulting graph showed that abnormally high spikes in temperatures can generally be seen occurring with more intense bleaching. A map of global coral bleaching sites alongside sea-surface temperature similarly signified that bleaching has historically occurred in areas where the average surface temperature has remained at or above 80 degrees Fahrenheit over recent decades. 

In order to consider possible mitigation strategies, we analyzed the recent spike in global average carbon emissions as well as their industrial sources across the past few decades. Unsurprisingly, we found transportation and power generation to be some of the greatest contributors, highlighting how gradual conversion to renewable energy sources over the next decades is essential to moderate rising sea surface temperatures and in turn coral bleaching events.
